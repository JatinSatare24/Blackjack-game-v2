> **A classic casino card game built with vanilla JavaScript.**

## 🎯 The Goal
The objective is simple: draw cards to get your total sum as close to **21** as possible without going over.

## ✨ Features
* **Random Card Generation:** Simulates a real deck using randomization logic.
* **Game State Management:** Tracks if the player is still "alive" or has "busted."
* **Win/Loss Logic:** Automatically detects Blackjack (21) or Game Over (>21).
* **Interactive UI:** Dynamic messages update based on the current state of the game.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling and layout.
* **JavaScript (ES6):**
  * Arrays for card storage.
  * `Math.random()` for card generation.
  * Conditional logic (`if/else`) for game rules.
  * DOM manipulation for UI updates.

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Click **"START GAME"** to get your first two cards.
2. Check your sum.
3. Click **"NEW CARD"** to draw another card if you are under 21.
4. Don't go over 21!
